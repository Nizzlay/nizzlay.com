I'm fascinated by *efficiency*, in a pretty broad sense of the word. You can name it tech, productivity, automation, flip-thinking, friction, whateverâ€¦ I'll ramble about all of them. And I'm opinionated too, even about stuff that's not efficiency related.

Besides the [blog](/blog/), you can read more [about me](/about/), the stuff I have painstakingly picked to [use](/uses/), and what I'm up to [now](/now/).
