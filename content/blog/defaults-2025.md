Default apps. Inspired by [Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097), and [catalogued](https://defaults.rknight.me/) by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/). 

I'm not a fan of trying to stick with the default apps that come with your OS. Your device should be personalised, *optimised*. Use apps that work best, *for you*. Customise apps, create your own automations, make it your own. It's *personal* computing.

Bonus points if other people struggle using your device, as it's *sooo you*.

That being said, let's give it a shot.
