Tadaaaa! ðŸ˜„

Here we are, again. Another version of my personal home on the internet. In English this time. Or at least primarily, I haven't fully decided yet. On a new domain name, because that made sense to me given the English context.

The [previous website](https://nielsgouman.nl/) is still online, but I might move the content and redirect some stuff at some point. 

In this case I chose [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), because Rust FTW. With the [Tabi theme](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/), which instantly convinced me with "optional JavaScript", and "perfect Lighthouse score". 

I was was very impressed with how easily I could get everything online Tabi's [starter template on GitHub](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start), and hosting it using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Sadly, Cloudflare Pages did not come with the benefit of analytics I was hoping for. And it did come with the downside of being relatively slow (page load time was over 500ms!).

So I've since switched it back to the trusted S3 with CloudFront hosting. It's not free like Cloudflare, but at the estimated cost of <â‚¬1 per month, it doesn't make much of a difference.

More (techy) details in the [colophon](/colophon/), and I'll try maintaining a [changelog](/changelog/) as well.
