A colophon is usually the last page of a book, giving some meta details about the book, such as the author, publisher, and editor. I quite like seeing a similar behind-the-scenes for websites, and it makes for a decent place to give credit where credit is due. 

## Code
The code for this website is fully [open source](https://github.com/Nizzlay/nizzlay.com), and hosted on GitHub.

I use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as a static website generator to convert all the (mostly Markdown) files into an actual website.

Automated deployments are done whenever I merge anything into the `main` branch, using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Nizzlay/nizzlay.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml). 

## Design
Pretty much all the design was done by [Óscar](https://osc.garden/), when he created the excellent [Tabi theme](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/) that I'm using. I've merely added in some variables using [my own skin](https://github.com/Nizzlay/nizzlay.com/blob/main/sass/skins/nizzlay.scss), and ditched the custom fonts.

## Tools & Services
I initially write in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). All code is edited using [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). I run Zola using [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), with the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/). 

The website is hosted using Amazon Web Services, deployed to an S3 bucket, and then distributed using CloudFront.

Domain names are managed by [mijn.host](https://mijn.host/).

## Content
Every single word on this website is written by me. It makes no sense to me to use AI for writing a personal website, but since I have pretty much no artistic skills[^1] I might ask it to create an image for me from time to time. No editors or anything fancy like that either, at most I might use a spellchecker _sometimes_.

All of this stuff I write is licensed © with the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). I really don't mind anyone using my work (please do!), but it would be nice if you give credit and make sure to be generous in your license as well. If you know a way to commercialize it, I'm open to it, but let's find a way to split profits fairly.
