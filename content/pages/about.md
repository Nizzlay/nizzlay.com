Nizzlay is me, Niels. I'm 30-something-old[^1] dude from Dordrecht, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. Hurray, orange. 

Let me introduce myself with a bunch of bulletpoints.

## Personality
- Apparently have a [INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/c611f87e457a5) personality, for whatever that's worth.
- Try to have indifferent as my default mood. Or "Stoic", if you want to be trendy about it.
- Dutch directness applies.
- Will not go with the consensus, especially if that is the main argument.
- Will find, and take, the other side of the debate (even if that's not my own standpoint), just so discussion can happen.
- Will inconvenience myself (and others) based on principles and technicalities.

## Lifestyle
- Works from home, and likes it.
- Will try to stand, or walk, while working[^3].
- *Kinda* sportsy, even if in my mind former, *very* sportsy, glory still applies. 
  - Doing martial arts in the form of cardio boxing
  - Play with rubber bands in the form of [X3](https://www.jaquishbiomedical.com/products/x3-bar/)
  - Throw some kettlebells around
  - Sometimes I might go for a run
  - Or even an obstacle course.

## Core values
In random order (otherwise I would have numbered them):
- Integrity
- Freedom
- Growth
- Positivity
- Simplicity

## Attitudes
- Reluctantly using Apple devices[^4].
- Get annoyed with formalities.
- Do not use a mouse, keyboard shortcuts (and trackpad) FTW.
- Assumptions are the mother of all fuck-ups.
- Tweak and optimise.

## Activities and Interests
- Built my first computer when I was 10, before even dial up internet was much of a thing.
- Been trained by David Allen in [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), over a decade ago.
- DIY, I've pretty much rebuilt our entire house[^7].

## Channels
- I don't follow the news.
- I dislike the overly SEO'ed and AI'ed internet.
- I will instantly dismiss anything "short". Doesn't matter if it's TikTok, YouTube, or Facebook. It's just hype, there's no space for nuance.

## Other random stuff
- Use [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) (technically [mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)), instead of QWERTY.
- My developer skills are pretty Rusty[^5]

## Demographics
- Dutch
- Male
- 16 September 1988[^6]
- Father of 2
- Lives in [Dordrecht, Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordrecht).

[^1]: I'm not vain about my age, just can't be bothered to remember to update this section all the time.
[^3]: Working from home, with an office job. Got to get some movement in my day somehow.  
[^4]: The hardware is pretty good, but I'll rant about the software. Sadly, the alternatives aren't great.
[^5]: Get it? Rust. It's a language, one that I like. Also, it's been quite a while since I've actually developed anything.
[^6]: See? Not vain. 
[^7]: Removed walls, increased ceiling height, added new walls, redid the electricity, create a new room for the washing machine (which implied cutting a drain into the floor).
