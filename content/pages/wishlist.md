If I have, in some way, provided value for you, and you would like to give back, this is a list of things, in random order, as inspiration.

<!-- toc -->

## Consumables
- **Tea**: Green or White. 
- **Money**: Sure all these other things are nice, but money is infinitely useful, so we can't ignore that. You can donate [via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NQFNQE6ADZJHN) or [via Bunq](https://bunq.me/Nizzlay).

## Tools
- **Leaf blower**: Makita. Battery powered, obviously.
- **Miter saw**: I can build stuff, but I'm not great with hand tools ðŸ˜…
- **Table saw**: A job-site kind of thing, on legs, that I can whip out for projects and store in the garage after. I don't have space for a permanent saw in my garage.
- **Hedge trimmer**: Dealing with cables is half of the time spent with these kinds of things, so definitely battery powered. Makita, as that's what I have all my batteries for.
- **Plunge saw**: With a track. Would save me a bunch of time fiddling with scrap pieces and clamps. 
- **Thermal imaging camera**: To find heat leaks, and help improve the thermal efficiency of our house.
- [**Pro Tech Toolkit**](https://www.ifixit.com/en-eu/products/pro-tech-toolkit): Or similar. Mostly a nice set to deal with the small screws in all these kid's toys.

## Gadgets
- **Mopping robot**: Automating the household chores.
- **Robot vacuum**: We've got a Roomba on the ground floor, but it would be nice to have another one so we can have one on each floor.
- [**Bag-A-Salt**](https://www.bugasalt.eu/): This looks like an amazing toy to deal with flies.
- [**Water meter**](https://www.homewizard.com/nl/watermeter/): I don't care that much about live tracking the consumption. Mainly to be used so I don't have to go underground into our crawl space once a year to report our consumption to the utilities company.
- **3D Printer**: I'm fascinated whenever I see what people can make using a 3D printer. Especially for organising stuff, there seems to be an interesting community.
- [**TRMNL**](https://usetrmnl.com/): Statusboards throughout the house.
- **Casio W-800H**: For the 99% of the time I just need a watch to check the time. Smart watches are only useful for workouts, and I rarely track those.

## Workout
- **Punchbag**: Water-air style, so that it can be left outdoors. 150 CM or 180 CM, so I can also do low kicks.
- **Captains of Crush**: Never tried them, but it looks like an interesting challenge.
- **Kettlebells**: Preferably with a rubber coating, as I mostly use them in the home-office. 20kg, 28kg, 32kg.
- **Vibram FiveFingers**: The only shoes I wear for workouts. I like the V-Train 2.0 and V-Run. Size 41.

## Office
- [**Svalboard keyboard**](https://svalboard.com/): Endgame ergonomics keyboard. Bonus points if you can get it to match my colour scheme.
- [**BenQ ScreenBar Pro**](https://www.benq.eu/en-eu/lighting/monitor-light/screenbar-pro.html): Better for the eyes. 
- [**Esington glass**](https://www.esington.com/products/esington-glass-new-edition-stop-time-large): Love this thing for doing pomodoro
- [**Time Timer**](https://www.timetimer.nl/time-timer-original-2/): As a nice simple pomodoro timer.

## Random
- [**Green roof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_roof): For sure on the dormer. Maybe also on the garage and extension, but not sure if those could support the weight.
- [**Daily Stoic Challenge Deck**](https://store.dailystoic.com/products/daily-stoic-challenge-deck?variant=31158744907885): Some interesting challenges for self-improvement.
- [**Mark Three**](https://www.studioneat.com/products/markthree): Mechanical pencil. Love the minimalism of this. Orange + Silver style is preferred.
- [**Mark One**](https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone): A pen. Love the minimalism of this. Orange + Silver style is preferred.
